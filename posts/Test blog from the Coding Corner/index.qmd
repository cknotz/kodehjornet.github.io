Welcome to the Coding Corner! This is a project from the Institute of Media and Social Sciences at the University of Stavanger.

Below you can see a really quick function in R, it is actually just 1+1! Can you understand what comes next?
This blog is created to help you as a student (and employee) to understand the different things which revolve around the quantitative methods universe. These blog posts are created during the Coding corner seminars.

Are you interested in us creating a blog post about something which you want to learn more about? Feel free to send an email to *codinghjornet\@gmail.com.*
