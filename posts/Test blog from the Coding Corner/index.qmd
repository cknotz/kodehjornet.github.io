Welcome to the Coding Corner! This is a project from the Institute of Media and Social Sciences at the University of Stavanger.

Below you can see a really quick function in R, it is actually just 1+1! Can you understand what comes next?

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Luckily, we think you are smarter than this, so this blog will include more than simple equations like 1+1. For example, you'll learn more about linear functions as well as case selection! Hope it helps you out!
