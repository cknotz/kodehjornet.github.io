This is a project from the Institute of Media and Social Sciences at the University of Stavanger.\nBelow you can see a really quick function in R, it is actually just 1+1! Can you understand what comes next?\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nLuckily, we think you are smarter than this, so this blog will include more than simple equations like 1+1. For example, you’ll learn more about linear functions as well as case selection! Hope it helps you out!"
