This blog is curated by a group of students working with the Coding corner project at the University of Stavanger, Norway. We give students and employees tips on quantitative and statistical methods.

We offer drop-in support every Tuesday from 10:15-12:00 at EOJ 376 (Meeting room at the departement of media- and social sciences).

The blog is currently being run by: Petter Knardahl and Knut Solvig.
