This is a project from the Institute of Media and Social Sciences at the University of Stavanger.\n\nBelow you can see a really quick function in R, it is actually just 1+1! Can you understand what comes next?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLuckily, we think you are smarter than this, so this blog will include more than simple equations like 1+1. For example, you'll learn more about linear functions as well as case selection! Hope it helps you out!\n",
